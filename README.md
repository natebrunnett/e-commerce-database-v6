# Note from the Developer
Hi everyone!  Here we have my latest and greatest version of a web app for demonstration purposes.  This build features API integration, token verification using json web token, a tight backend, and a tight frontend.  Components can easily be moved around and the project structure / foundation is essentially my idea of a sturdy web application.

# Run this project locally

     config.js -> const URL = 'http://localhost:3030'
     $ cd client & npm i & npm start
     $ cd server & npm i & nodemon

# Epilogue 
This project does need many updates in order for it to have a more modern approach at solving issues with ease of use for the users.  However, I hope that you are impressed with what I have here :)
